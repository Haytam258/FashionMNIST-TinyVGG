# FashionMNIST with TinyVGG

This is a small project created during my Deep Learning with PyTorch course in which we use the built-in FashionMNIST Dataset from PyTorch and compare 3 different models:
* 2 of which are small basic neural networks (one linear, the other is non-linear)
* The last model is a replica of TinyVGG by CNN Explainer https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/

The goal is to compare the performance of each of the models and see which one performs best on the FashionMNIST Dataset.

# Platform
It was made in google colab rather than Python scripts.
